      <h3>What is the Tuesday TechJam?</h3>
      <p>The Tuesday TechJam (formerly, the Hack Club) is the place wehere the Freeformers Community: it aims to help digital makers by connecting them online and at venues in London and elsewhere. In a Freeformers Tuesday TechJam is where you can find everything you need to set your ideas free with tech. Join in to make friends, meet new partners, and meet experts from Freeformers. We run coding nights, design and Web remixing fests, entrepreneur bashes â€“ anything that fits with liberating ideas with tech! If you don't have a clue what you want to work on, the Tuesday TechJam can act as a channel to a group of experts and potential collaborators to discuss suitable and feasible app ideas</p>
      <p>The Tuesday TechJam provides a fun and supportive space where you can bounce ideas, co-develop and hang out with Freeformers. So, if you've enjoyed a Freeformers Digital Immersion or Innovation Worksjop and want to take things to the next level or develop your own ideas on a more personal level with a Freeformer's expert or with fellow collaborators you meet there, then the Hack Club is where you want to be.</p>
      <h3>When and Where does the Tuesday TechJam Meet?</h3>
      <p>The main Freeformers Tuesday TechJam is held every Tuesday from 5:15pm until 7:30pm in the Freeformers office on the Strand, near Covent Garden.</p>
